# Cloud Native Buildpack Shim

[![CI](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-shim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-shim/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> [!WARNING]
> This project is deprecated (and about to be sunset) and does not support modern Buildpack API and lifecycle versions.
>
> Please switch to native CNB implementations rather than using this shim.

> See [Heroku's natively supported CNB languages](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks#supported-languages) or [search for community buildpacks](https://registry.buildpacks.io/).

This is a Cloud Native Buildpack that acts as a shim for classic [Heroku Buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#classic-buildpacks).
